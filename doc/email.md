# Email

For this kind of projects it is important to have the possibility to send emails to the users or to a subset of users.

The primary feature is the selection. The simplest minimal viable product is the ability to fill the clipboard with a selection of email address in order to copy them in a regular email client software.

More sophisticated feature would support the sending of automatic reminders, news-letter, etc. Note that most of these automatic emails are usually spam and that it is not what I want to encourage. Some usage however are legitimate.

# Short Text Messages

In the same spirit the application should be able to notify by SMS.
