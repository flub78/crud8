# Calendar

(still a project)

A calendar is a basic feature for a lot of Web application. This porject will provide the basic features.

* Calendar views per month/week/day
* events CRUD callable from the calendar view.

It will also provide a framework for extensions with the possibility to add new types of events and to add business logic.
For example it will be possible to create a reservation system with several type of resources (for example a classsroom, a teacher and a limited number of student, etc.).

# Maybe later

* connection with Google Calendar
